This repository houses code and resources for a breast cancer detection project employing machine learning techniques. The project's objective is to predict the presence of breast cancer in women through diagnostic image analysis. I utilize the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset for training and assessment. To get started, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the main script. The achieved accuracy on the test dataset is provided, along with detailed performance metrics and visualizations in the 'results' directory.
